Sarah failed the last semester of her freshman year in high school, and made a fake report card. 
She forgot that the report cards got sent home at the end of the year and her mom got her hands on it before she got home one day.
When her mom asked her why she did so badly, she blamed the school, saying that they had made a mistake and had to get them to "correct" it.
After a couple of weeks of nagging Sarah, her mom forgot about it and she never had to tell her the truth.

However, one day her mother decided to clean her room after Sarah leave home for the second semester and found that fake report card.
She rememberred that affair and made a phone call to Sarah about it and Sarah explains that it was because the university found the mistake and corrected that.
Sarah's mother said she believed it, but she still felt suspicious about it.
Sarah thought the affair about her record and record card was end and forgot about it.
