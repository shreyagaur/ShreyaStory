Sarah failed the last semester of her freshman year in high school, and made a fake report card. 
She forgot that the report cards got sent home at the end of the year and her mom got her hands on it before she got home one day.
When her mom asked her why she did so badly, she blamed the school, saying that they had made a mistake and had to get them to "correct" it.
After a couple of weeks of nagging Sarah, her mom forgot about it and she never had to tell her the truth.
